Transfer neuronal cell culture to work solution & sample chamber assembly
=========================================================================


## Protocol:
#### 1. Preparation

1.1. Washing small petri dish (30 mm) for cover glass in distillated water twice

1.2. Clean workspace of the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) using 70% ethanol in sprayer

1.3. Check for required equipment (table below):


| Tool       | Description                  | Note                        |
|------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Pipette    | 1 ml                         |                             |
| Tips       | 1 ml                         |                             |
| Tweezers   |                              |                             |
| Ethanol    | 96%                          |  for tweezers sterilization |
| Petri dish | D=30 mm, previosly cleaned   |                             |


1.4. Put tools and equipment on BSC
    
1.5. Start BSC sterilization by 15-20 min UV

**Warning: DO NOT stare at UV light even trough the glass**

1.6. Prepare aliquot of Outside Solution what  qualified for your experiment and add glucose to concentration 10 mM

*Note: for an experiment lasting 5-6 hours approximately and one sample chamber volume of ~2 ml, 10 ml (18 mg of glucose) of Outside Solution will be enough*

#### 2. Taking a cover glasses
    
2.1. Open observe door of the CO2-incubator to choosing multidish with appropriate cultivations term

2.2.
