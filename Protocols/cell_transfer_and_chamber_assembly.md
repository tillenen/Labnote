Transfer neuronal cell culture to work solution & sample chamber assembly
=========================================================================

Protocol for preparing the hippocampal neurons cell culture to the electrophysiology experiments.

Borys Olifirov, 2020

## Protocol:
### 1. Preparation

1.1. Prepare aliquot of a Outside Solution what qualified for your experiment and add glucose (Mr = 180.2 g/mol) to concentration 10 mM and 
warm the solution to room temperature

*Note: for an experiment lasting 5-6 hours and one sample chamber volume of ~2 ml, 10 ml (18 mg of glucose) of Outside Solution will be enough*

1.2. Clean workspace of the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) using 70% ethanol in sprayer

1.3. Check for required equipment (table below):


| Tool       | Description                  | Note                                        | 
|------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Pipette    | 1 ml                         |                                             |
| Tips       | 1 ml                         |                                             |
| Tweezers   |                              |                                             |
| Ethanol    | 96%                          | for tweezers sterilization                  |
| Petri dish | D=30 mm                      | twice rinse with distilled water            |


1.4. Put tools and equipment on BSC
    
1.5. Start BSC sterilization by 15-20 min UV

**Warning: DO NOT stare at UV light even trough the glass**


### 2. Cover glasses transfer
    
2.1. Take 24-well plate from CO2-incubator and choose the well for next preparation using inverted microscope

**Warning: **

2.2. 


### 3. Osmolarity transfer

3.1. Add 3 ul of DL-AP5 Stock Solution (S.S.) to the dish with cover glass and gently mix contents

*Note: DL-AP5 is the NMDA-channels antagonist. It increases cell survivance by depressing spontaneous neuronal activity*

3.2. Replace a culture medium to the Outside Solution step by step to decrease osmotic shock:

|  remove vol.  |  add vol.  |  Incubation time  |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|
|      -        |  500 ul    |  10 min           | 
|  500 ul       |  700 ul    |  10 min           |
|  700 ul       |  1 ml      |  10 min           |

*Note: after the last step of the solution transfer, cells can stay at the dish for long time,  just replace ~1 ml of Outside Solution every 40 min - 1 hour*


### 4. Sample chamber assembly

4.1. Rinse parts of the chamber with distilled water wipe wipe their dry

4.2. silicone grease
